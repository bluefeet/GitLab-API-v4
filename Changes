   should help people debug issues easier.

 - Fix delete_runner so that it doesn't try to decode the response.
 - Any 204 response now just blanket returns undef.

0.21 2019-08-24T18:56:13Z

 - The release endpoint returns a 403 on an unknown tag rather than a
   404 like it should.  This condition is now detected and treated
   like a 404.

0.20 2019-07-23T21:42:37Z

 - The preexisting create_release and edit_release methods have been
   renamed to create_tag_release and update_tag_release to make room
   for the new releases API.

   release links APIs.

 - Add the commit_refs method.
 - Add the trigger_pipeline method.
 - Document some create_pipeline method parameters.

0.17 2019-02-20T22:47:58Z

 - Require perl 5.10.1 as I give up trying to support 5.8 due to other
   modules requiring 5.10 and strictures/multidimensional issues.
 - Simplify VERSION declarations.

0.16 2019-02-18T06:21:15Z

 - Migrate build tooling from Dist::Zilla to Minilla.

0.15 2019-01-09

 - BREAKING CHANGE: gitlab-api-v4 now takes parameters in the form of
   param:value rather than --param=value.  This is to avoid foot-gun
   ambiguities when options have the same names as parameters (such
   as --url).
 - Add --pretty and --canonical options to gitlab-api-v4.

0.14 2018-12-04

 - Add all_project_members and all_group_members methods.
 - gitlab-api-v4 now handles -- like you'd expect your typical linux
   tooling would.

0.13 2018-11-08

 - group() now accepts parameters.
 - Add the transfer_project_to_namespace() method.

0.12 2018-09-11

 - Added API methods for Protected Tags, Search, Project
   Import/Export, Project Badges, Resource Label Events, Discussions,
   Markdown, Group Issue Boards, Group Badges, and Snippets.
 - Reorganized project/group members/access requests sections to
   better match the official API.
 - Renamed the various project snippet methods to have "project" in
   their name.
 - Added constants for the snippet visibility levels.
 - Overhauled the POD heading layout in order to avoid the massive
   TOC.
 - Fix minor typo.

0.11 2018-09-01

 - Fixed the raw_file method to not try to decode the respository file
   contents and instead just return the undecoded response content.
 - Renamed the POD section "FILE METHODS" to
   "REPOSITORY FILE METHODS", to better match the GitLab API docs.
 - Add the hidden NO_ACCESS constant to ::Constants.
 - Live tests now run against GitLab CE 11.2.3 (was 10.2.2).

0.10 2018-06-05

 - Fix project_hook() so it uses the correct path.
 - create_project_hook() and edit_project_hook() now return their
   decoded response (the hook).
 - delete_project_hook() no longer tries to return anything as a
   successful delete is a 204 (no content) and a failed one is a 404.
 - Tests for all of the above.
 - Fix typo.

0.09 2018-05-28

 - Ensure chmod 600 of ~/.gitlab-api-v4-config is maintained.
 - Enable and fix upload_file_to_project by using
   HTTP::Tiny::Multipart.
 - Individual methods may now have a custom note added to their POD.
 - Added a self-contained unit test, unit.t, which can be expanded on
   in the future.  This is unlike regression.t which requires that a
   GitLab installation be available.
 - Added the rest_client_class argument.

0.08 2018-05-14

 - Many API endpoints which return lists and did not support
   parameters now do in order for pagination arguments, and the
   paginator, to be used with them.
 - Add project_languages method.
 - Remove upload_file_to_project since it doesn't work.  Will re-add
   when it is made to work later.

0.07 2018-05-10

 - Completely overhaul ::RestClient to use HTTP::Tiny instead of
   Role::REST::Client.  This change will make it much easier to alter
   the behavior of the HTTP communication.
 - ::RestClient now supports the ability to decode non-ref JSON, such
   as unblock_user which returns just a JSON boolean.
 - block_user and unblock_user now return their decoded response.
 - delete_user is no longer expected to return anything.
 - Response decoding will now only be attempted for methods which are
   expected to return something.  Slight optimization.
 - A 404 on a non-returning method throws an exception now, matching
   the docs.
 - The *_token arguments are now stored in a closure to help users
   avoid accidentally dumping them somewhere such as logs.
 - Added all methods for the TODO API.

0.06 2018-04-09

 - Add the project_service method.

0.05 2018-03-06

 - Fixup gitlab-api-v4 to support parameters who's values are empty or
   have whitespace in them.

0.04 2018-02-03

 - Support parameters in the project method.
 - Allow wide characters when printing the response output in the
   gitlab-api-v4 script.

0.03 2018-01-12

 - Greatly extended authentication and configuration options for the
   gitlab-api-v4 script; added GitLab::API::v4::Config.
 - The gitlab-api-v4 script now always outputs JSON (the default was
   YAML, with the option to pick other formats).
 - Fixed the fork_project method to hit the correct URL.

0.02 2017-12-15

 - Fix double-slashes in URL paths.
 - Fixed gitlab-api-v4 script to actually work.

0.01 2017-12-11

 - Added the sudo method and the sudo_user argument.
 - Split the token arguments into the access_token and private_token
   arguments.
 - Removed the login/email/password arguments as they are not
   supported by v4.
 - Many many methods added/removed/renamed/modified.
 - Imported GitLab::API::v3 @
   fb9253c58b68ca1be71feedf12c1d6004c8ba8d6.
