  spec: pipeline = POST projects/:project_id/pipeline?
  note: |
    Git ref (branch or tag) name must be specified in the C<ref> field of the
    C<%params> hash. It's also possible to pass variables to a pipeline in
    the C<variables> field like in the following example:

        my $pipeline = $api->create_pipeline(
            $project_id,
            {
                'ref'     => 'master',
                variables => [
                    { 'key' => 'VARIABLE1', 'value' => 'VALUE1' },
                    { 'key' => 'VARIABLE2', 'value' => 'VALUE2' },
                ],
            },
        );
- retry_pipeline_jobs: pipeline = POST projects/:project_id/pipelines/:pipeline_id/retry
- cancel_pipeline_jobs: pipeline = POST projects/:project_id/pipelines/:pipeline_id/cancel
- delete_pipeline: DELETE projects/:project_id/pipelines/:pipeline_id
