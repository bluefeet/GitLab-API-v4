=pod

The C<author/> directory contains the logic for generating the v4.pm
module.

=head1 DATA FILES

The C<author/config.yml> drives the order and configuration of
individual sections.

The YAML files in the C<author/sections/> directory have lines
like this:

    - SUB: HTTP_METHOD PATH [NS]
    - SUB: RETURN = HTTP_METHOD PATH? [NS]

=head2 SUB

The name if the subroutine that will be created in v4.pm.

=head2 RETURN

The name of the return variable if any.  This is used as part of
generating the documentation.  If no return variable is declared
then the subroutine will return an empty list no matter what
the API response returns.

=head2 HTTP_METHOD

One of GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.

=head2 PATH

The path to the API endpoint (after the /api/v4 bit).
The path is a list of static and dynamic strings separate by
forward slashes.  So, if you have:

    /foo/:bar/baz

Then the API subroutine would require one argument which would
be injected in place of C<:bar>.

=head2 ?

If the PATH ends with a C<?> then this signifies that the API
endpoint accepts query parameters.

=head2 NS

NS "No Serialize" Just return raw contents do not try to serialize it.

=head1 GENERATING

To generate C<lib/GitLab/API/v4.pm> do this:

    cd author
    perl generate.pl > ../lib/GitLab/API/v4.pm
