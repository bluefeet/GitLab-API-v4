=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Net::Gitlab> purports to provide an interface to the GitLab API, but
it is hard to tell due to a complete lack of documentation via either
POD or unit tests.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING

This module is auto-generated from a set of YAML files defining the
interface of GitLab's API.  If you'd like to contribute to this module
then please feel free to make a
L<fork on GitHub|https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4>
and submit a pull request, just make sure you edit the files in the
C<authors/> directory instead of C<lib/GitLab/API/v4.pm> directly.

Please see
L<https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4/blob/master/author/README.pod>
for more information.

Alternatively, you can
L<open a ticket|https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4/issues>.
