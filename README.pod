=head1 NAME

GitLab::API::v3 - A complete GitLab API v3 client.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GitLab::API::v3;
    
    my $api = GitLab::API::v3->new(
        url   => $v3_api_url,
        token => $token,
    );
    
    my $branches = $api->branches( $project_id );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a one-to-one interface with the GitLab
API v3.  Much is not documented here as it would just be duplicating
GitLab's own L<API Documentation|http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/README.html>.

Note that this distribution also includes the L<gitlab-api-v3> command-line
interface (CLI).

=head2 CONSTANTS

Several values in the GitLab API require looking up the numeric value
for a meaning (such as C<access_level> and C<visibility_level>).
Instead of doing that, you can use L<GitLab::API::v3::Constants>.

=head2 EXCEPTIONS

The API methods will all throw (hopefully) a useful exception if
an unsuccessful response is received from the API.  That is except for
C<GET> requests that return a C<404> response - these will return C<undef>
for methods that return a value.

If you'd like to catch and handle these exceptions consider using
L<Try::Tiny>.

=head2 LOGGING

This module uses L<Log::Any> and produces some debug messages here
and there, but the most useful bits are the info messages produced
just before each API call.

=head2 PROJECT ID

Note that many API calls require a C<$project_id>.  This can be
specified as either a numeric project C<ID>, or as a
C<NAMESPACE_PATH/PROJECT_PATH> in many cases.  Perhaps even
all cases, but the GitLab documentation on this point is vague.

=head2 RETURN VALUES

Many of this module's methods should return a value but do not
currently.  This is due to the fact that this module was built
as a strict representation of GitLab's own documentation which
is often inconsistent.

If you find a method that should provide a return value, but
doesn't currently, please verify that GitLab actually does
return a value and then submit a pull request or open an issue.
See L</CONTRIBUTING> for more info.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=head2 url

The URL to your v3 API endpoint.  Typically this will be something
like C<http://git.example.com/api/v3>.

=head2 token

A GitLab API token.

=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=head2 rest_client

An instance of L<GitLab::API::v3::RESTClient>.  Typically you will not
be setting this as it defaults to a new instance and customization
should not be necessary.

=head1 UTILITY METHODS

=head2 paginator

    my $paginator = $api->paginator( $method, @method_args );
    
    my $members = $api->paginator('group_members', $group_id);
    while (my $member = $members->next()) {
        ...
    }
    
    my $users_pager = $api->paginator('users');
    while (my $users = $users_pager->next_page()) {
        ...
    }
    
    my $all_open_issues = $api->paginator(
        'issues',
        $project_id,
        { state=>'opened' },
    )->all();

Given a method who supports the C<page> and C<per_page> parameters,
and returns an array ref, this will return a L<GitLab::API::v3::Paginator>
object that will allow you to walk the records one page or one record
at a time.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Net::Gitlab> purports to provide an interface to the GitLab API, but
it is hard to tell due to a complete lack of documentation via either
POD or unit tests.

interface of GitLab's API.  If you'd like to contribute to this module
then please feel free to make a
